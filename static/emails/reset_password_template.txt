Hello, @@USERNAME@@!

Warning! By resetting your password, you revoke your current cryptographic keys to generate new cryptographic keys. Udia cannot reverse the arrow of time that is entropy.

Once your master password is reset, you will:

Lose your existing encrypted secrets
  You will not be able to decrypt your existing secrets.
Revoke your current cryptographic signature
  You will not be able to sign items for the existing signature key pair.
Forfeit your ongoing asymmetricly encrypted items
  You will not be able to use your existing asymmetric key pair.

Resetting your password will allow you to authenticate and create content using newly generated keys.
